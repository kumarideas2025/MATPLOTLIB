 # matplotlib is our main package and pyplot is our module 
# matplotlib is like a studio --> and pyplot is given some ready-mate function--

# line plot/chart--> it is one of the basic types of data visualization used to show how values change over a sequence 

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
x=[1,2,3,4]
# x=horizontal axis 
y=[10,20,15,25]
# y=vertical axis

plt.plot(x,y) 
plt.show()
