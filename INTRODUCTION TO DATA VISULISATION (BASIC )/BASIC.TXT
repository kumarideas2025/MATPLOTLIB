PROBLEM STATEMENT:-
 

without visualization-
1.manually
2.time effect
3.logic

data visualization-
Boring  data(numbers,text,) to colorful,clear and meaning-full data 

1-data science
2-business 
3-healthcare
4-finance
5-education
6-government

library-
matplotlib ,seaborn, plotly,pandas(plot) :-
basic and powerful plotting, statistical plots built on matplotlib, web-based visualization, quick plots from data frames


DATA VISUALIZATION ADVANTAGE-
SAVE TIMES----understanding data quickLy
EASY COMMUNICATION---explain data to anyone
SPOT TRENDS AND PATTERNS---see data's movement
BETTER DECISION MAKING---make informed choices
HANDLES BIG DATA WELL---understand thousands of rows



without  ---1-hard ,2-1000 rows/slow ,3-can not find trends ,meeting(last one year data--on excel/csv),5-many error
with -------1-easy,2-quickly,3-trend pattern spot ,4-graphes and diagrmame,5-minimum error


(5) points--->
1--images 60000 times faster 
2--can lie (error in data,wrong color greading) ....so use proper threads ...use color properly 
3--90% big data are fail..so use first(data explore visualay)--this process prevent wasting time on bad models
4--7 pieces of data at once by our brain ...so use graph,pie-chart
